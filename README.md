newLISP-on-Rockets
==================

Source code for both the newLISP on Rockets framework and the blog it is hosted on.

NOTE: This is a VERY early version of the code.  Forget pre-alpha, this is basically pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha.

As such it should in no way be used for anything, ever.  That's the disclaimer.

Current version is 0.05. See newlisp-rockets.lisp for more information.
