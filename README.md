newLISP-on-Rockets
==================

Source code for both the newLISP on Rockets framework and the blog it is hosted on.

NOTE: This is a VERY early version of the code.  Forget pre-alpha, this is basically pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha.

As such it should in no way be used for anything, ever.  That's the disclaimer.

What is newLISP-on-Rockets?
---------------------------

It's a very simple web application framework running on newLISP.  My goal is to simplify the applications I am already writing in newLISP by consolidating a bunch of useful functions for both front-end (jQuery) and back-end (SQLite) operations.  The emphasis is on simplicity and code conciseness.

See newlisp-rockets.lisp for more information.
