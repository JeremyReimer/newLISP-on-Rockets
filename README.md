newLISP-on-Rockets
==================

Source code for both the newLISP on Rockets framework and an example application, a blog that runs on Rockets.

NOTE: This is a very early version of the code.  To get the blog to work on a new server would require creating a database with various tables (Users, Posts, etc).  At the moment I do not have any installation scripts to create such a thing.  They will be coming later on, once the framework matures.

Please check the blog for updates on the status of the project.

DISCLAIMER: In no way should this software be used to control actual rockets.  

What is newLISP-on-Rockets?
---------------------------

It's a very simple web application framework running on newLISP.  My goal is to simplify the applications I am already writing in newLISP by consolidating a bunch of useful functions for both front-end (jQuery) and back-end (SQLite) operations.  The emphasis is on simplicity and code conciseness.

See newlisp-rockets.lisp for more information.
